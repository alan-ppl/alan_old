Alternative approach:
  trace has a number of protected dimensions
  trace builds up a list of names
  distribution calls check that we aren't encroaching on those dimensions
  

  fixed, named dims
  increment dim each time you encounter a new distribution
  

Papers:
single standard proposal in each dimension followed by Gibbs sampling for k \in {0, 1}
  good balance of simplicity and efficiency
  with symmetric MHMC proposal, don't even need to compute proposal probability!
  extension: multiple samples in each dimension (PNAS 2014)
use VI objective and recognition model to estimate good proposal bandwidth
  reparameterise for HMC/Langevin
define proposals/variational posteriors that capture strong prior correlation by conditioning
reparameterised tensorised Langevin/HMC
  need full joint rejection
  initially use non-indexed samples IID N(0, 1)
  later add attraction between all samples, such that marginally, particles still generated N(0, 1) + likelihood
