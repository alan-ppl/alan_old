Alan: Probabilistic Programming with Massively Parallel Importance Weighting
=====================================================

This library showcases Massively Parallel Importance Weighting in the context of Variational Inference based probabilistic programming. Using Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) and Reweighted Wake Sleep (RWS) as inference methods, for a graphical model with $n$ latent variables we can obtain $K^n$ proposals where $K$ is determined by the user. This improves inference performance and allows for...
