Trace:          program -> list of log_prob tensors
Combine:        list of log_prob tensors -> list of log_prob tensors, summed across groups
Rearrange:      dict of log_prob tensors -> dict of dicts of log_prob tensors, dividing by plates
(Optimization): choose a good order to sum over variables
Sum:            sum over each plate


groups (otherwise, we will conflate _k_dims and latent variables)
