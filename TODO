Traces:
  Dict mapping names to different kinds of torchdims (or names if the backend uses torchdims)
    timeseries name -> Kcurr
    timeseries name -> Kprev
    timeseries name -> T
    timeseries name -> Tm1
    K name          -> K dim
    plate name      ->        train plate dim
    plate name      -> test + train plate dim
  Easy to switch between torchdims and named if we have these kinds of mapping. 



Use log-determinant trick to extract conditionals.
Gibbs sampling.
Options for time-series:
  Only sample the final state.
  Sample all states.
