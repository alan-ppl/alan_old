Warning that everything's going to break if you use multisample=False.
Local Importance weighting

Sampling from the conditional prior
  sampling from the conditional prior with more plates
  test moments
  test log-likelihood

Timeseries


Traces:
  Dict mapping names to different kinds of torchdims (or names if the backend uses torchdims)
    timeseries name -> Kcurr
    timeseries name -> Kprev
    timeseries name -> T
    timeseries name -> Tm1
    plate name      ->        train plate dim
    plate name      -> test + train plate dim
  Easy to switch between torchdims and named if we have these kinds of mapping.

How to integrate side information?
  - maybe trace p needs a function that ensures the side information has the right plates?
