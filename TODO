Posterior sampling:
  TraceP collects a dict mapping K_name -> list_of_var_names (which is usually necessary, but we do need when K_group).
  Gather log_p for K_name, by adding together log_p in list_of_var_names.
  Use log-determinant trick to extract conditionals.
  Gibbs sampling.
  Options for time-series:
    Only sample the final state.
    Sample all states.
