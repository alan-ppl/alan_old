can define normal and Normal as different.
need extra info (K, groups) alongside the distribution, and its hard to put that in as arguments to the distribution?
normal(2, 3, K=4, group="a")

Put dists in trace!

sub-distributions 

trace["a"](Normal(2, 3), K=..., group=...)

a = normal(trace["a"], 2, 3, K=..., group=...)
